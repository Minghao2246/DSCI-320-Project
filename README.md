Analysis, design, and implementation of static and interactive visual representations; visualization literacy; data communication; exploratory Data Analysis; application of theoretical principles to visualization development.
In this project, we will delve into the Spotify dataset to examine, analyze, and uncover the connections and associations among various factors. Our analysis includes visualizations such as heat maps, bar charts, and scatter plots. Additionally, we have incorporated user interactions such as bi-directional interaction and mouse-based interaction, including tooltips, hover effects, and clicks. Moreover, we have included a user interface dropdown menu and a range slider for enhanced user control.
